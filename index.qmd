I am a full time doctor working in anaesthesia and intensive care medicine based in North London.
My research background is in the operationalisation of routinely collected healthcare records for research.
Particularly where research goals may be challenging to answer under traditional frameworks because anticipated effect sizes are very small, that it is too expensive, or there are concerns over equipoise.
My PhD investigated the safe limits of these resources, which provide unique challenges to be overcome, both infratructurally and methodoligically.

I often get asked to share my slides or notes on various topics ranging from journal club to medical education.
And so I have started to collate these here as a resource to direct people to.
This is going to mostly be a collection of less formal work, that I don't think necessaily warrents a submission to a journal, but is perhaps something I've spoken about one too many times in the coffee room, and so would benefit from being researched more deeply and written down.
I welcome criticsm and discussion of any of the ideas published here.

As a past fellow of the Software Sustainability Institute, I am a strong proponent of open data, reproducible research and free[^1] and open software.
When I'm not tinkering with ventilators or R, I try to spend as much time as possible with my wonderful partner and children.
