      <description>Preamble I wrote this editorial some years ago in response to the deluge of reports that reappraise prior studies with the fragility index and the subsequent permeation of this method into the medical community. Sadly, I could not get the article picked up by a medical journal, and so I am posting it here. I hope this is of use to medical community who currently use the fragility index.</description>
