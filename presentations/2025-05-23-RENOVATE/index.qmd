## Learning Objectives / Housekeeping

:::{.fragment}

- Develop an intuition for Bayesian statistics.
- Appreciate the differences between Bayesian and frequentist reasoning.
- Unlearn a few bad statistical habits!

:::
:::{.fragment}

- No maths. No formulas\*. Accessible to all.
- Interactive. Feel free to interrupt.
- No singling out, but volunteers welcome.
- Some statistical concepts are so ingrained, keep an open mind.

## Let's Challenge Our Assumptions

- An RCT investigated the effect of steroids in septic shock on mortality.
- Mortality was 43% in the treatment group and 49.1% in the control group (p = 0.03).
- What is the correct interpretation of this p value?

## Let's Challenge Our Assumptions

- An RCT investigated the effect of steroids in septic shock on mortality.
- The relative risk of mortality in the treatment group was 0.88 (95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 0.99).
- What is the correct interpretation of this 95% confidence interval?

## My Prediction

:::{.fragment}

- No more will get the answers than would be expected by random chance.

:::
:::{.fragment}

- These are hard questions, but foundational.
- These concepts come from "Frequentist statistics".
- Bayesian statistics conceptualises probabilities differently.
- Most frequentist statistics are interpreted incorrectly; already Bayesian?

:::
:::{.fragment}

- If you are confused. That's ok.

  - Antibiotics
  - ..
  - Oxygen
- Non-pharmacological
  - Positioning
  - Sputum clearance
  - Mechanical support: IMV, NIV/CPAP, HFNO

## Background

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
*Non-invasive Ventilation*

  - Delivers a pressure differential
  - Can titrate O2 occording to need
  - Augments minute volume
  - Applies PEEP
  - Limits interventions, often poorly tolerated
  - Need breaks to eat etc.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
*High Flow Nasal Oxygen*

  - Provides high inspiratory flow in excess of peak inspiratory flow
  - Bulk flow reduces deadspace
  - Comfortable; patients wear it for longer.
  - Heated and humidified
  - ?PEEP; skeptical
:::

::::

## Background

- Both are useful tools when used correctly.
- Dynamic evidence landscape
- Infective aetiologies and NIV?
- RECOVERY-RS: CPAP
- FLORALI: HFNO
- HERNANDEZ: HFNO

---

## Population

- Inclusion Criteria:
  - Aged $\geq$ 18 y/o admitted to hospital (ED/ICU/Wards) with ARF
  - Spo2 <90% or PaO2 < 7.9 kPa RA

## Population

1. Nonimmunocompromised ARF
2. Immunocompromised ARF
3. Acute Cardiogenic Pulmonary Oedema (ACPO)
4. COPD
5. COVID-19

## Intervention

- HFNO
  - Airvo-2, Fisher & Paykel Healthcare
  - Flow:
    - 30L/min in COPD, 45L/min otherwise
    - Titrated up to 60L/min as tolerated
  - FiO2:
    - Started at 0.5
    - COPD: titrated for SpO2 88-92% 
    - Other groups: 92-98%

NIV rescue therapy was allowed for COPD and ACPO only.

## Control

- NIV (face mask)
  - Pressure:
    - COPD: IPAP 12-16 cmH2O, EPAP 4 cmH2O
    - Other groups: IPAP 12-14 cmH2O, EPAP 8cmH2O
    - Maximum IPAP 20 cmH2O EPAP of 12cmH2O
  - Tidal volume:
    - 6-9 ml/Kg\* of ideal body weight
  - FiO2: as for intervention

24hr use of NIV encouraged.

## Outcome

- Primary: Endotracheal intubation (or death) within 7 days of randomisation
  - Criteria for intubation standardised
- Secondary:
  - 28 + 90 day mortality 
  - Mechanical ventilation-free days at 28 days 
  - ICU-free days at 28 days
- Tertiary:
  - ICU + Hospital LOS within 90 days
  - Vasopressor-free days within 28 days
  - The proportion of patients who received a do-not-intubate order within 7 days after randomisation

## Key Methods

- Non-inferiority unblinded bayesian adaptive randomised controlled trial.

- 5 distinct groups.
- "Adaptive"; dynamic borrowing.
- 1:1 randomisation, permuted block size, allocation concealment.
- Interim analyses: futility, non-inferiority, or superiority.
- Composite outcome.

## Key Methods

- **Non-inferiority** unblinded **bayesian** adaptive randomised controlled trial.

- 5 distinct groups.
- "Adaptive"; dynamic **borrowing**.
- 1:1 randomisation, permuted block size, allocation concealment.
- Interim analyses: futility, non-inferiority, or superiority.
- Composite outcome.

## Non-inferiority Trial

:::{.fragment}

- Most RCTs are "superiority" trials; is one treatment "better" than the other?

:::
:::{.fragment}

- Is this always necessary?
- Is one treatment less toxic or less expensive?
- One can be "better" if clinical efficacy the same.

:::
:::{.fragment}

- How do you *prove* that two treatments are the same?
- Can anyone recognise the issue?

## It's About precision

- Without enough data, all comparisons are non-inferior

## Let's go Bayesian

:::{.fragment}

- A simulated trial

:::
:::{.fragment}

- **Population**: 10 Adults from the general population admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of septic shock.
- **Intervention**: “Vaso-pushin”™; 5 patients
- **Control**: Standard care; 5 patients
- **Outcome**: Increase in MAP. MCID increase of 10 mmHg assuming baseline MAP of 55.

## Borrowing

:::{.fragment}

- Let's conduct a thought experiment

:::
:::{.fragment}

- Consider an RCT in ARF conducted in 2024 and another in 2025.
- How might information transfer from one to the other?

:::
:::{.fragment}

- Could we include the controls of the 2024 study as "controls" in the 2025 study?
- Why might we want to do this?

:::

## {background-image="./prior-meme.png"}

## Borrowing

- Bayesian approach naturally allows for borrowing
- Caution must be exercised
- Are the groups really similar? Are they "exchangeable"?
- Increased precision
- But... results will gravitate towards the group mean

# Trial Results

## {background-image="./flow.png" background-size=contain}

## {background-image="./table-1.png" background-size=contain}

## Stopping Criteria

- April 2021 (1st interim); immunocompromised. **Futility**. n = 51
- March 2023 (5th interum); COVID-19, **non-inferiority**. n = 895
- Oct 2023 (6th interum); Non-immunocomprimise, **non-inferiority**. n = 501
- Oct 2023 (6th interum); Cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, **non-inferiority**. n = 274
- Final analyis: COPD. n = 79

# Conclusions

## Conclusions

- Met pre-specified criteria for non-inferiority for 4 of 5 cohorts
- But... results not robust to strong modelling assumptions (borrowing)
- Need further study: COPD, immunocompromised and ACPO

## Stengths

- Large, multi-centred RCT.
- Bayesian; transparent.
- Auhtors conclusions are well made.
- Broad generalisability for the patients I see.
- Others...

## Weaknessess

- Late (but necessary) inclusion of COVID-19 to trial protocol.
- Modification of trial protocol to include death as composite outcome.
- Very small numbers for COPD ?selection bias.
- Over/inappropriate borrowing from dissimilar groups; failed sensitivity analysis.
- Criteria for futility too harsh.
- High cross over from HFNO to NIV in COPD.
- Others...

## My Take Aways

- You can't bayesian your way out of a bad idea.
- Reasurring and has equipoise for ARF.
- Has challenged my assumptions for ACPO.
- I would still use NIV first line in COPD, and CPAP in ACPO.
- And what about yours...
