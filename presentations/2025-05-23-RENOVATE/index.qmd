## Learning Objectives / Housekeeping

:::{.fragment}

- Develop an intuition for Bayesian statistics.
- Appreciate the differences between Bayesian and frequentist reasoning.
- Unlearn a few bad statistical habits!\*

:::
:::{.fragment}

- No maths. No formulas. Accessible to all.
- Interactive. Feel free to interrupt.
- No singling out, but volunteers welcome.
- Some statistical concepts are so ingrained, keep an open mind.

## Let's Challenge Our Assumptions

A double blind multi-centre randomised controlled trial investigated the effect of a steroid combination in septic shock on 90-day mortality. 
90-day mortality was 43% in the treatment group and 49.1% in the control group (p = 0.03).

What is the correct interpretation of this p value?

A double blind multi-centre randomised controlled trial investigated the effect of steroids in septic shock on 90-day mortality. 
The relative risk of 90-day mortality in the treatment group was 0.88 (95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 0.99).
What is the correct interpretation of this 95% confidence interval?

## My Prediction

- These are hard questions.
- Likely that the correct answer will not be well identified.

- These concepts come from "Frequentist statistics".
- Bayesian statistics is conceptualises probabilities differently.

## Background

- Number of different approaches to managing ARF
- Pharmacological:
  - bronchodilators
  - antibiotics
  - ..
  - Oxygen
- Non-pharmacological
  - Positioning
  - Sputum clearance
  - Mechanical support: IMV, NIV/CPAP, HFNO

## Background

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
Non-invasive Ventilation

  - Delivers a pressure differential
  - Can titrate O2 occording to needs
  - Augments minute volume
  - Applies PEEP
  - Limits interventions, often poorly tolerated
  - Need breaks to eat etc.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
High Flow Nasal Oxygen

  - Provides high inspiratory flow in excess of peak inspiratory flow
  - Bulk flow reduces deadspace
  - Comfortable; patients wear it for longer.
  - Heated and humidified
  - ?PEEP; skeptical

## Background

- Useful tools when used correctly.
- Dynamic evidence landscape
- Infective aetiologies and NIV?
- RECOVERY-RS
- FLORALI
- HERNANDEZ

### Population

- Inclusion Criteria:
  - Aged $\geq$18 y/o admitted to hospital (ED/ICU/Wards) with ARF
  - Spo2 <90% or PaO2 < 7.9 kPa RA
  - Signs of increased WOB or tachypnoea >25 bpm

- Exclusion Criteria:
  - Urgent need for endotracheal intubation
  - Prolonged respiratory pauses  
  - Cardiorespiratory arrest  
  - GCS $\leq$ 12  
  - Heart rate < 50 bpm with decreased level of consciousness
  - Arterial blood pH < 7.15
  - Haemodynamic instability 
  - Contraindication to NIV (vomiting, secretions, GCS < 12, pneumothorax)
  - Do not intubate order
  - NIV use in ACPO prior to randomisation

## Population

1. Nonimmunocompromised ARF
2. Immunocompromised ARF
3. Acute Cardiogenic Pulmonary Oedema (ACPO)
4. COPD
5. COVID-19

## Intervention

- HFNO
  - Airvo-2, Fisher & Paykel Healthcare
  - Flow:
    - 30L/min in COPD, 45L/min otherwise
    - Titrated up to 60L/min as tolerated
  - FiO2:
    - Started at 0.5
    - COPD: titrated for SpO2 88-92% 
    - Other groups: 92-98%

NIV rescue therapy was allowed for COPD and ACPO only.

## Control

- NIV (face mask)
  - Pressure:
    - COPD: IPAP 12-16 cmH2O, EPAP 4 cmH2O
    - Other groups: IPAP 12-14 cmH2O, EPAP 8cmH2O
    - Maximum IPAP 20 cmH2O EPAP of 12cmH2O
  - Tidal volume:
    - 6-9 ml/Kg\* of ideal body weight
  - FiO2: as for intervention

24hr use of NIV encouraged.

## Outcome

- Primary: Endotracheal intubation (or death) within 7 days of randomisation 
- Secondary:
  - 28-day mortality 
  - 90-day mortality 
  - Mechanical ventilation-free days at 28 days 
  - ICU-free days at 28 days
- Tertiary:
  - Hospital LOS within 90 days
  - ICU LOS within 90 days
  - Vasopressor-free days within 28 days
  - The proportion of patients who received a do-not-intubate order within 7 days after randomisation

## Key Methods

- Non-inferiority unblinded bayesian adaptive randomised controlled trial.

- 5 distinct groups.
- "Adaptive"; dynamic borrowing.
- 1:1 randomisation, permuted block size, allocation concealment.
- Interim analyses: futility, non-inferiority, or superiority.
- Composite outcome.

## Key Methods

- **Non-inferiority** unblinded **bayesian** adaptive randomised controlled trial.

- **5 distinct groups**.
- "Adaptive"; **dynamic borrowing**.
- 1:1 randomisation, permuted block size, allocation concealment.
- Interim analyses: futility, non-inferiority, or superiority.
- Composite outcome.

## Non-inferiority Trial

- Most RCTs are "superiority" trials; is one treatment "better" than the other?

- Is this always necessary?
- Is one treatment less toxic or less expensive?
- One can be "better" if clinical efficacy the same.

- How do you *prove* that two treatments are the same?
- Can anyone recognise the issue?

## Bayesian

Population: 10 Adults from the general population admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of septic shock.
Intervention: “Vaso-pushin”™; 5 patients
Control: Standard care; 5 patients
Outcome: Increase in MAP. MCID increase of 10 mmHg assuming baseline MAP of 55. 80% power at 0.05 alpha threshold.

## Non-inferiority Trial

- The standard should be against the best practice standard? Does that hold true for ACPO

## Borrowing

- Let's conduct a thought experiment
- Consider a placebo RCT in CAP conducted in 2024 and another in 2025
- How might information transfer
- Could we include the controls of the 2024 study as "controls" in the 2025 study?
- Why might we want to do this?

“If the historical information differs substantially from the concurrent, Bayesian methods may borrow strength from a biased source, leading to an inflated Type I error rate, as well as the possibility of needing to run a longer, more expensive trial in order to overcome the incommensurate prior data” ([Lewis et al., 2019, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/LFTKEEA4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/2NTHEE8X?page=2&annotation=9GUVNL7Z))

## Weaknessess

- Late (but necessary) inclusion of COVID-19 to trial protocol
- Modification of trial protocol to include death as composite outcome
- Very small numbers for COPD
- Over borrowing from dissimilar groups; failed sensitivity analysis
- High cross over from HFNO to NIV in COPD

## Take Aways

- Reasurring and has equipoise for ARF
- I would still use NIV first line in COPD, and CPAP in ACPO
