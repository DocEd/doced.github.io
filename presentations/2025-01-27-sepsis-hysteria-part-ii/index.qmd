## Part 1...

:::{.fragment}

- We reviewed the "sepsis-six" and its (lack) of evidence.
- Sepsis is a complex and unsolved problem.
- We should be warey of simple answers to complex problems.

:::
:::{.fragment}

- Objectives for today:
  - Define sepsis and understand its historical context.
  - Consider sepsis as a *hetrogenous* syndrome.
  - Understand the gap between infection and sepsis and what fills it.
  - Review management and best practices in "early" sepsis.

:::

## History & Definitions

- Sepsis (1992) Bone et al.[@Bone1992]
  - Consensus definition for: SIRS, sepsis, severe sepsis, septic shock.
  - $\text{Sepsis} = \text{SIRS} + \text{Infection}$

:::{.fragment}

- Sepsis 2 (2001) Levy et al.[@Levy2003]
  - Consensus defintion: unchanged. Expanded some diagnostic criteria.
  - Noted: *SIRS insensitive and non-specific*.

:::
:::{.fragment}

- Sepsis 3 (2016) Singer et al.[@Singer2016]
  - Empiric defintiion
  - $\text{Sepsis} = \text{SOFA} + \text{Infection}$
  - "Sepsis" retired. "Severe sepsis" = "sepsis".
  - Sepsis: 10% mortality. Organ *dysfunction*
  - Septic shock: 40% mortality; Organ *failure*.

## Definitions

> Sepsis is a life threatenin organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection
>
> *Singer et al.*[@Singer2016]

:::{.fragment}

1. Infection
1. Dysregulated host response
1. Organ dysfunction (and failure)
1. Life threatening

:::

## Organ Failure

![](SOFA-score.png)

## Pathophysiology

::: {.incremental}

- It's... complicated
- DAMPS and PAMPS
- Vasoplegia and mitochondrial failure

:::

## Immune and Cellular

::: {.incremental}

 - Pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs): well conserved foreign cellular apparatus e.g. endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide).
- Identification of PAMPs by: dendritic cells, macrophages etc.
- Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs); toll-like receptors
- Inflammatory mediators are released: TNF-alpha, IL-1 and IL-6.
- These recruit and activate polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs).
- PMNLs arrive at the site of infection to release inflammatory mediators designed to kill foreign microbes.
- Damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs): host material like mitochondrial DNA released during cellular injury ("friendly fire").
- PRRs assemble into molecular complexes: inflammasomes
- Inflammasomes involved in secretion of the highly potent cytokines IL-1$\beta$ and IL-18 (triggering cellular apoptosis)

:::

## Immune and Cellular

- The net effect:
  - Increase number, lifespan and activation of innate immune cells.
  - Induce hepatic acute phase proteins: complement and fibrinogen
  - Trigger neutrophils to release extracellular traps (NETs)
  - Upregulate tissue factor expression by blood monocytes (immune mediated thrombosis)
- So far... this is all perfectly normal... 

## Early Damage Pathway

:::{.fragment}

- Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) damage cellular proteins and DNA.
- Mitochondrial function impaired; bioenergenic failure.
- Widespread thrombosis: microvascular flow dysfunction with organ failure.

:::
:::{.fragment}

- A number of negative feedback loops begin to amplify:
  - Cellular ischaemia
  - Intracellular/mitochondrial dysfunction
  - Lactataemia
  - Self sustained cytokine production and inflammatory dysregulation.

# Is it sepsis?^[Disclaimer: cases are fictional but inspired by real cases.]

## Is it sepsis?

An 85 year old patient presenting to the A&E with 3 days history of myalgia and non-specifc deterioration; "off legs".

Initial observations: SpO2 not-recordable as patient moving too much. BP 110/75. HR 95 sinus. RR 20. Patient confused and agitated, temp 36.4.

Initial labs: WCC 10.5, Plts 33, CRP 208, INR 3.1, Fibrinogen 85.

## Is it sepsis?

A 35 year old with a 3 day history of cough productive of green sputum. Now feels SOB so took self to A&E. Otherwise well.

Initial observations: SpO2 78% RA. RR 35. Febrile 38. HR 110. BP 135/85.

Initial labs: WCC 14, CRP 85

VBG: Lactate 0.8

## Is it sepsis?

A 17 year old with a 36 hour history of migratory RIF pain. Parents brought to A&E.

Initial observations: SpO2 99% RA. RR 20. Febrile 38. HR 110. BP 135/85.

Initial labs: WCC 14, CRP 85

VBG: Lactate 0.8

## Sepsis as a Syndrome

::: {.incremental}

- Not always immediately clear if a severe infection is sepsis
- Sepsis is not a single disease
- Extremely heterogeneous
- Unified by common themes
- The microbial zoo:
  - Predators: Group A Strep, Staphylococcus Aureus, Neisseria meningitidis
  - Cohabitants: Lot's of others
  
:::

## Paradox of Early Treatment

- Sepsis was necessarily redefined: SOFA
- But this creates a vacuum:
  - What do we do *before* they become septic?
  - Can we prevent it?
  - When does someone "become" septic?
- Proper sepsis, especially if vulnerable, is an emergency
- If everything is an emergency, nothing is.

## How the void was filled

:::{.fragment}

- "Red flag sepsis"
- Sepsis screening

:::
:::{.fragment}

- Identify different populations
- Criticisms of "missed sepsis" often totally unfounded
  - Asking for "pre-sepsis" not "early sepsis".

:::

## Practical Advice

- Clarify potential source of infection:
  - Different for new admissions vs. inpatients
  - "Septic screen"?... "Infection Inquest"
- Clarify organ dysfunction:
  - Which organs are effected and how?
- Culture *before* ABx wherever possible.
  - Sputum, urine, CSF, pus etc.
  - Blood cultures: Aerobic first, 10 mL each.

## Practical Advice

- Source control, source control, source control.

![](source-control-meme.png)

## Practical Advice

- Source control, source control, source control.
- Give ABx considering the likely source.
- Investigations (including imaging) directed to find source.
- 20-30 mL/Kg: fluids for hypotension
  - Call the ICU
  - Accept when patients are no longer fluid responsive
  - Refractory lactataemia likely doesn't reflect hypovolaemia
- Review your patient often. Get help and escalate.

## Our Turn  

- Organ support: buys time
- Don't cause harm: Lung protective ventilation. Catheter care etc.
- Some potential treatments:
  - Albumin
  - NorAdrenaline, Vasopressin
  - Methylene Blue
  - Steroids

## Documenting your Review

- Write the diagnosis in terms of the definition: Infection + Organ Dysfunction
- Consider other differentials/sepsis mimics using a surgical sieve
- Avoid terms like “urosepsis”, “chest sepsis” etc.
- Avoid one-liners: "impression sepsis"
- It's ok to write: simple infection and *doesn't* have sepsis.
- It's ok to describe uncertainty: Possible, probable, confirmed etc.

## Documenting your Review

Probable sepsis from a pneumonic (lung) source manifesting as cardiovascular (hypotension), respiratory (oxygen requirement) and renal (AKI) organ dysfunctions.
 
Microbial source as yet undefined.

Main differentials include: cardiogenic pulmonary oedema and PE.

**PLAN**

1. Obtain sputum
2. Blood cultures followed by immediate ABx to cover for community respiratory organisms.
3. Fluid resuscitation directed by capillary refil with 2 hourly VBGs to check for lactate clearance.
4. C-XR
5. Consider CT-PA

Plan initiated with senior review to follow.

## Guidelines

![](nice-guidelines.png)
![](ssc-guidelines.png)

## NICE

> Think 'could this be sepsis?' if a person presents with symptoms or signs that indicate possible infection.

- Troubling that this is the first recommendation in their guideline
- But...
  - Take a proper history and examine. Be systematic.
  - Create a differential diagnosis
  - Sepsis *should* be part of any differential in at risk populations or non-specific presentations.
- Know the groups at high risk of developing sepsis
- Pregnancy, children, neutropaenia, the predators.
- Perform a full secondary survey if someone hasn't previously
- Use and apply NEWS-2

## NICE

> take microbiological and blood samples before giving an antimicrobial.

> give a broad-spectrum antimicrobial at the maximum recommended dose, without delay (within 1 hour of identifying that they meet any high risk criteria), if antibiotics have not already been given for this episode of sepsis

> discuss with a consultant.

> [Clinician $\geq$FY2] think about alternative diagnoses to sepsis

## SSC[@surviving-sepsis-trial-2021a]

- Recommends against qSOFA for screening (prefer NEWS)^[Unclear if this will change based on emerging evidence.]

> For patients with sepsis induced **hypoperfusion or septic shock** we suggest that at least 30 mL/kg of intravenous (IV) crystalloid fluid should be given within the first 3 h of resuscitation

- Guide resuscitation with "dynamic parameters"
- Target lactate clearance, but also capillary refil.[@andromeda-shock-trial-2019]

## Question Your Assumptions

::: {.fragment}

|                | Patient Getting Better | Patient Getting Worse |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| I know whats going on    | Great! No Change        | Are you missing something? Second opinion. Check your biases. |
| I don't know whats going on  | Seek education        | The bad place. Get help immediately.        |

:::
::: {.fragment}

- Almost all my referrals are the right column by definition.
- Most patients come to hospital, get the right diagnosis, and get better.
- Some patients come to hospital and despite treatment get worse.
  - Did we get it wrong?

:::

## Lacking evidence

- IVIG. Maybe. Specific predators.
- Vitamin C. Lol Nope.
- Anti-coagulation. Nope.
- Extra-corporeal absorption: High flux CVVH. Nope.
