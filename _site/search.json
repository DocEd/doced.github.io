    "text": "CAPE-COD was a randomised controlled trial that reported in the NEJM in early 2024. I will assume that the reader has read the trial. But if not, please have a look at the following links:\n\nOriginal link\nBottom line1 (structured review)\nEd and Todd podcast (narrative review)\n\nThe steroid evidence landscape in intensive care is complex. Really complex. There are a number of conditions that we encounter in the ICU that may benefit from steroids including septic shock, meningitis and ARDS. The story in community acquired pneumonia is somewhat less clear. A number of small RCTs, which were almost certainly underpowered, have been unable to detect a mortality benefit thus far. And so the stage was set for a larger RCT that was better powered to answer this important question.\nAnacdotally, since this trial was announced, I have seen a huge increase in the steroids prescribed for pneumonia. This includes variations in dose, frequency, indication and duration. It seems like word of this trial has entered the medical imagination, and the result is that many more people are getting steroids than were before."

    "text": "Integrating with Other Major Trials\nThere are two major trials that interact with this one. First, DEXA-ARDS which has several notable flaws. Most strikingly, the lack of appropriate blinding, questions over the way in which allocation concealment was performed and the lack of hyperglycaemia in the treatment arm. With further limitations from the exclusion of patients with prior corticosteroid exposure. While I cannot ignore the findings, and I would certainly administer dexamethasone to patients with established ARDS, I would want another trial to be conducted that essentially bridges these two trials. Essentially a properly blinded ARDS trial, where prior steroid use wasn’t an exclusion criteria. The question would then be, doe s\nThe second is APROCHSS, which was a double blind randomised control trial investigating the use of hydrocortisone plus fludrocortisone in established septic shock. Briefly, patients in this trial were much sicker, with a minimum noradrenaline requirement of 0.25, commensurate SAPS and SOFA scores, and a control group mortality of xx. Although this was all comers with sepsis, the single largest group would have been severe community acquired pneumonia. Looking at the supplement xx. Again, this study excluded those who were exposed to prior steroids.\nThere is now an abundance of data to show that steroids in septic shock speed shock resolution, and likely improve mortality.\nThe third is HYPRESS which used steroids (hydrocortisone only)in sepsis in an attempt to prevent the onset of shock.\nInteraction with DNAR orders"

    "text": "I am a full time doctor working in anaesthesia and intensive care medicine based in North London. My research background is in the operationalisation of routinely collected healthcare records for research. Particularly where research goals may be challenging to answer under traditional frameworks because anticipated effect sizes are very small, that it is too expensive, or there are concerns over equipoise. My PhD investigated the safe limits of these resources, which provide unique challenges to be overcome, both infratructurally and methodoligically.\nI often get asked to share my slides or notes on various topics ranging from journal club to medical education. And so I have started to collate these here as a resource to direct people to. This is going to mostly be a collection of less formal work, that I don’t think necessaily warrents a submission to a journal, but is perhaps something I’ve spoken about one too many times in the coffee room, and so would benefit from being researched more deeply and written down. I also think it’s a good idea to voice ideas and opinions in a public manner, so as to invite criticsm and discussion.\nI am a strong proponent of open data, reproducible research and free1 and open software. I was a fellow of the Software Sustainability Institute and have ongoing collaborations with the Alan Turing Institute to explore the use of synthetic patient data to facilitate these goals in clinical research.\nWhen I’m not tinkering with ventilators or R, I try to spend as much time as possible with my wonderful partner and children."
