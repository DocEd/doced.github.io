  abstract = {Background Traditional approaches to mechanical ventilation use tidal volumes of 10 to 15 ml per kilogram of body weight and may cause stretch-induced lung injury in patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome. We therefore conducted a trial to determine whether ventilation with lower tidal volumes would improve the clinical outcomes in these patients.
Methods Patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized trial. The trial compared traditional ventilation treatment, which involved an initial tidal volume of 12 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight and an airway pressure measured after a 0.5-second pause at the end of inspiration (plateau pressure) of 50 cm of water or less, with ventilation with a lower tidal volume, which involved an initial tidal volume of 6 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight and a plateau pressure of 30 cm of water or less. The first primary outcome was death before a patient was discharged home and was breathing without assistance. The second primary outcome was the number of days without ventilator use from day 1 to day 28.
Results The trial was stopped after the enrollment of 861 patients because mortality was lower in the group treated with lower tidal volumes than in the group treated with traditional tidal volumes (31.0 percent vs. 39.8 percent, P=0.007), and the number of days without ventilator use during the first 28 days after randomization was greater in this group (mean [{$\pm$}SD], 12{$\pm$}11 vs. 10{$\pm$}11; P=0.007). The mean tidal volumes on days 1 to 3 were 6.2{$\pm$}0.8 and 11.8{$\pm$}0.8 ml per kilogram of predicted body weight (P{$<$}0.001), respectively, and the mean plateau pressures were 25{$\pm$}6 and 33{$\pm$}8 cm of water (P{$<$}0.001), respectively.
Conclusions In patients with acute lung injury and the acute respiratory distress syndrome, mechanical ventilation with a lower tidal volume than is traditionally used results in decreased mortality and increases the number of days without ventilator use. (N Engl J Med 2000;342:1301-8.)},

However, clinicians need confidence in the robustness of trial findings. The Fragility Index may complement frequentist analysis and provide quantitative assessment of robustness. We searched MEDLINE for peri-operative critical care randomised controlled trials that reported a statistically significant difference in mortality. We identified 46 trials with 37,347 participants. The median (IQR [range]) Fragility Index was 2 (1-3 [0-49]). Eleven trials had a Fragility Index of zero (changing from the Chi-square test to Fisher's exact test removed significance) and seven trials had a Fragility Index of 1. Only 23/46 trials had a Fragility Index greater than the number of patients lost to follow-up. There was a strong positive correlation between the Fragility Index and: the number of participants, R2 ~=~0.97, p~{$<~$}0.0001; the number of centres that recruited participants, R2 ~=~0.96, p~{$<~$}0.0001; the number of nations that recruited participants, R2 ~=~0.93, p~{$<~$}0.0001; and the number of deaths, R2 ~=~0.97, p~{$<~$}0.0001.

One investigator screened for trials and then recorded data from them, including sample size per group, event rate per group, and the dichotomous outcome analyzed by trialists. The FI and FQ for each outcome were calculated. Outcomes were then surveyed to determine whether the outcome used for analysis aligned with the guideline recommendation.
Results: Thirty-five RCTs were included in this study. Thirty-three of 35 (94\%) FIs were based on the trial outcomes referenced in the clinical practice guideline. The median sample size was 2548 participants ([IQR], 522\textendash 6946). The median total number of events for each outcome was 403 (IQR, 86\textendash 969). Nineteen (54\%) P Values were below 0.05, 8 (22.4\%) were below 0.01. The median FI for all trials was 16 (IQR, 4\textendash 29). The median FQ was 0.007 (IQR, 0.003\textendash 0.014). FI was not related to risk of bias or Science Citation Index but was significantly correlated with sample size (for significant trials; r = 0.77, P {$<$} .001, for neutral trials; r = 0.76, P {$<$} .001).
Conclusions: We found that the robustness of RCTs varied, but on the whole were not robust in nature. Most trials demonstrated a modest FI and FQ. As a result, conclusions drawn from these trials should take this information into account.},

METHODS: Our investigation assessed the robustness of the underlying evidence in 21 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) used to support treatment recommendations in the 2016 update of the CHEST Guideline and Expert Panel Report on Antithrombotic Therapy for VTE Disease. We calculated the fragility index and fragility quotient for qualifying outcomes within RCTs.
RESULTS: The median fragility index for all studies was 5 (interquartile range, 1-9), with a median fragility quotient of 0.012 (interquartile range, 0.002-0.032).
CONCLUSIONS: Our conclusions parallel those of previous investigations of the fragility of RCT outcomes; we found that some outcomes used to support recommendations in AT10 are fragile. We recommend that the fragility index and fragility quotient be adopted as measures of robustness of clinical trial outcomes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the most trustworthy source for evaluating treatment effects, but RCTs of spine surgery interventions often produce discordant results. The Fragility Index is a novel metric to inform about the robustness of statistically significant results.
PURPOSE: The aim was to determine the robustness of statistically significant results from RCTs of spine surgery interventions. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: This was a systematic survey. PATIENT SAMPLE: The sample included RCTs of spine surgery interventions. OUTCOME MEASURES: The Fragility Index is the minimum number of patients in a trial whose status would have to change from a nonevent to an event to change a statistically significant result to a nonsignificant result. Events refer to the occurrence of any dichotomous outcome, such as successful fusion, incident fracture, adjacent segment degeneration, or achievement of a certain functional score. A small Fragility Index indicates that the statistical significance of a result hinges on only a few events, and a large Fragility Index increases one's confidence in the observed treatment effects.
METHODS: We systematically reviewed a database for evidence-based orthopedics and identified all the RCTs that reported at least one positive outcome (ie, p!.05). Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility and extracted data. We used the Fisher exact test to compute Fragility Index values and multivariable linear regression to evaluate potential associated factors.
RESULTS: We identified 40 eligible RCTs with a median sample size of 132 patients (interquartile range [IQR] 79\textendash 208) and a median total number of outcome events for the chosen outcome of 31 (IQR 13\textendash 63). The median Fragility Index was two (IQR 1\textendash 3), which means that adding two events to one of the trial's treatment arms eliminated its statistical significance. The Fragility Index was less than or equal to three events in 75\% of the trials, and was less than or equal to the number of patients lost to follow-up in 65\% of the trials. Fragility Index values correlated positively with total sample size (r50.35; p!.05). When adjusted for losses to follow-up and risk of bias, increasing Fragility Index values were associated only with increasingly significant reported p values (p!.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Statistically significant results in spine surgery RCTs are frequently fragile. The addition of only a small number of outcome events can completely eliminate significance.},

  abstract = {IMPORTANCE: It has not been established whether noninvasive ventilation (NIV) reduces the need for invasive mechanical ventilation in patients who develop hypoxemic acute respiratory failure after abdominal surgery.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether noninvasive ventilation improves outcomes among patients developing hypoxemic acute respiratory failure after abdominal surgery.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter, randomized, parallel-group clinical trial conducted between May 2013 and September 2014 in 20 French intensive care units among 293 patients who had undergone abdominal surgery and developed hypoxemic respiratory failure (partial oxygen pressure {$<$}60 mm Hg or oxygen saturation [SpO2] {$\leq$}90\% when breathing room air or {$<$}80 mm Hg when breathing 15 L/min of oxygen, plus either [1] a respiratory rate above 30/min or [2] clinical signs suggestive of intense respiratory muscle work and/or labored breathing) if it occurred within 7 days after surgical procedure.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive standard oxygen therapy (up to 15 L/min to maintain SpO2 of 94\% or higher) (n\,=\,145) or NIV delivered via facial mask (inspiratory pressure support level, 5-15 cm H2O; positive end-expiratory pressure, 5-10 cm H2O; fraction of inspired oxygen titrated to maintain SpO2 {$\geq$}94\%) (n\,=\,148).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was tracheal reintubation for any cause within 7 days of randomization. Secondary outcomes were gas exchange, invasive ventilation-free days at day 30, health care-associated infections, and 90-day mortality.
RESULTS: Among the 293 patients (mean age, 63.4 [SD, 13.8] years; n=224 men) included in the intention-to-treat analysis, reintubation occurred in 49 of 148 (33.1\%) in the NIV group and in 66 of 145 (45.5\%) in the standard oxygen therapy group within+ 7 days after randomization (absolute difference, -12.4\%; 95\% CI, -23.5\% to -1.3\%; P\,=\,.03). Noninvasive ventilation was associated with significantly more invasive ventilation-free days compared with standard oxygen therapy (25.4 vs 23.2 days; absolute difference, -2.2 days; 95\% CI, -0.1 to 4.6 days; P\,=\,.04), while fewer patients developed health care-associated infections (43/137 [31.4\%] vs 63/128 [49.2\%]; absolute difference, -17.8\%; 95\% CI, -30.2\% to -5.4\%; P\,=\,.003). At 90 days, 22 of 148 patients (14.9\%) in the NIV group and 31 of 144 (21.5\%) in the standard oxygen therapy group had died (absolute difference, -6.5\%; 95\% CI, -16.0\% to 3.0\%; P\,=\,.15). There were no significant differences in gas exchange.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure following abdominal surgery, use of NIV compared with standard oxygen therapy reduced the risk of tracheal reintubation within 7 days. These findings support use of NIV in this setting.

  abstract = {Background: High-quality, evidence-based orthopaedic care relies on the generation and translation of robust research evidence. The Fragility Index is a novel method for evaluating the robustness of statistically significant findings from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). It is defined as the minimum number of patients in 1 arm of a trial that would have to change status from a nonevent to an event to alter the results of the trial from statistically significant to nonsignificant.
Purpose: To calculate the Fragility Index of statistically significant results from clinical trials in sports medicine and arthroscopic surgery to characterize the robustness of the RCTs in these fields.
Methods: A search was conducted in Medline, EMBASE, and PubMed for RCTs related to sports medicine and arthroscopic surgery from January 1, 2005, to October 30, 2015. Two reviewers independently assessed titles and abstracts for study eligibility, performed data extraction, and assessed risk of bias. The Fragility Index was calculated using the Fisher exact test for all statistically significant dichotomous outcomes from parallel-group RCTs. Bivariate correlation was performed to evaluate associations between the Fragility Index and trial characteristics.
Results: A total of 48 RCTs were included. The median sample size was 64 (interquartile range [IQR], 48.5-89.5), and the median total number of outcome events was 19 (IQR, 10-27). The median Fragility Index was 2 (IQR, 1-2.8), meaning that changing 2 patients from a nonevent to an event in the treatment arm changed the result to a statistically nonsignificant result, or P   .05.
Conclusion: Most statistically significant RCTs in sports medicine and arthroscopic surgery are not robust because their statistical significance can be reversed by changing the outcome status on only a few patients in 1 treatment group. Future work is required to determine whether routine reporting of the Fragility Index enhances clinicians' ability to detect trial results that should be viewed cautiously.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rectal indometacin decreases the occurrence of pancreatitis after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). However, the population most at risk and the optimal timing of administration require further investigation. We aimed to assess whether pre-procedural administration of rectal indometacin in all patients is more effective than post-procedural use in only high-risk patients to prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis.
METHODS: We did a multicentre, single-blinded, randomised controlled trial at six centres in China. Eligible patients with native papilla undergoing ERCP were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio (with a computer-generated list) to universal pre-procedural indometacin or post-procedural indometacin in only high-risk patients, with stratification by trial centres and block size of ten. In the universal indometacin group, all patients received a single dose (100 mg) of rectal indometacin within 30 min before ERCP. In the risk-stratified, post-procedural indometacin group, only patients at predicted high risk received rectal indometacin, immediately after ERCP. Investigators, but not patients, were masked to group allocation. The primary outcome was overall ocurrence of post-ERCP pancreatitis. The analysis followed the intention-to-treat principle. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02002650.
FINDINGS: Between Dec 15, 2013, and Sept 21, 2015, 2600 patients were randomly assigned to universal, pre-procedural indometacin (n=1297) or risk-stratified, post-procedural indometacin (n=1303). Overall, post-ERCP pancreatitis occurred in 47 (4\%) of 1297 patients assigned to universal indometacin and 100 (8\%) of 1303 patients assigned to risk-stratified indometacin (relative risk 0{$\cdot$}47; 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}34-0{$\cdot$}66; p{$<$}0{$\cdot$}0001). Post-ERCP pancreatitis occurred in 18 (6\%) of 305 high-risk patients in the universal group and 35 (12\%) of 281 high-risk patients in the risk-stratified group (p=0{$\cdot$}0057). Post-ERCP pancreatitis was also less frequent in average-risk patients in the universal group (3\% [29/992]), in which they received indometacin, than in the risk-stratified group (6\% [65/1022]), in which they did not receive the drug (p=0{$\cdot$}0003). Other than pancreatitis, adverse events occurred in 41 (3\%; two severe) patients in the universal indometacin group and 48 (4\%; one severe) patients in the risk-stratified group. The most common adverse events were biliary infection (22 [2\%] patients vs 33 [3\%] patients) and gastrointestinal bleeding (13 [1\%] vs ten [1\%]).
INTERPRETATION: Compared with a risk-stratified, post-procedural strategy, pre-procedural administration of rectal indometacin in unselected patients reduced the overall occurrence of post-ERCP pancreatitis without increasing risk of bleeding. Our results favour the routine use of rectal indometacin in patients without contraindications before ERCP.

  abstract = {The fragility index (FI), the number of events the statistical significance a result depends on, and the number of patients lost to follow-up are important parameters for interpreting randomised clinical trial results. We evaluated these two parameters in randomised controlled trials in anaesthesiology. For this, we performed a systematic search of the medical literature, seeking articles reporting on anaesthesiology trials with a statistically significant difference in the primary outcome and published in the top five general medicine journals, or the top 15 anaesthesiology journals. We restricted the analysis to trials reporting clinically important primary outcome measures. The search identified 139 articles, 35 published in general medicine journals and 104 in anaesthesiology journals. The median (inter-quartile range) sample size was 150 (70e300) patients. The FI was 4 (2e17) and 3 (2e7), and the number of patients lost to follow-up was 0 (0e18) and 0 (0e6) patients in trials published in general medicine and anaesthesiology journals, respectively. The number of patients lost to follow-up exceeded the FI in 41 and 27\% in trials in general medicine journals and anaesthesiology journals, respectively. The FI positively correlated with sample size and number of primary outcome events, and negatively correlated with the reported P-values. The results of this systematic review suggest that statistically significant differences in randomised controlled anaesthesiology trials are regularly fragile, implying that the primary outcome status of patients lost to follow-up could possibly have changed the reported effect.},

  abstract = {Objectives: The Fragility Index (FI) is a novel tool for evaluating the robustness of statistically significant findings in a randomized control trial (RCT). It measures the number of events upon which statistical significance depends. We sought to calculate the FI scores for RCTs in the head and neck cancer literature where surgery was a primary intervention. Data Sources: Potential articles were identified in PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase, and Cochrane without publication date restrictions. Review Methods: Two reviewers independently screened eligible RCTs reporting at least one dichotomous and statistically significant outcome. The data from each trial were extracted and the FI scores were calculated. Associations between trial characteristics and FI were determined.
Results: In total, 27 articles were identified. The median sample size was 67.5 (interquartile range [IQR] 5 42\textendash 143) and the median number of events per trial was 8 (IQR 5 2.25\textendash 18.25). The median FI score was 1 (IQR 5 0\textendash 2.5), meaning that changing one patient from a nonevent to an event in the treatment arm would change the result to a statistically nonsignificant result, or P {$>$}.05. The FI score was less than the number of patients lost to follow-up in 71\% of cases. The FI score was found to be moderately correlated with P value (q 5 20.52, P 5.007) and with journal impact factor (q 5 0.49, P 5.009) on univariable analysis. On multivariable analysis, only the P value was found to be a predictor of FI score (P 5.001).
Conclusions: Randomized trials in the head and neck cancer literature where surgery is a primary modality are relatively nonrobust statistically with low FI scores.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Recent literature has drawn attention to the potential inadequacy of frequentist analysis and threshold p values as tools for reporting outcomes in clinical trials. The fragility index, which is a measure of how many events the statistical significance of a result depends on, has been suggested as a means to aid the interpretation of trial results. This study aimed to calculate the fragility index of clinical trials in critical care medicine reporting a statistically significant effect on mortality (increasing or decreasing mortality).
DATA SOURCES: Literature search (PubMed/MEDLINE) to identify all multicenter randomized controlled trials in critical care medicine.
STUDY SELECTION: We identified 862 trials; of which 56 fulfilled eligibility criteria and were included in our analysis.
DATA EXTRACTION: Calculation of fragility index for trials reporting a statistically significant effect on mortality, and analysis of the relationship between trial characteristics and fragility index.
DATA SYNTHESIS: The median fragility index was 2 (interquartile range, 1-3.5), and greater than 40\% of trials had a fragility index of less than or equal to 1. 12.5\% of trials reported loss to follow-up greater than their fragility index. Trial sample size was positively correlated, and reported p value was negatively correlated, with fragility index.
CONCLUSIONS: In critical care trials reporting statistically significant effects on mortality, the findings often depend on a small number of events. Critical care clinicians should be wary of basing decisions on trials with a low fragility index. We advocate the reporting of fragility index for future trials in critical care to aid interpretation and decision making by clinicians.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Evidence-based medicine is guided by our interpretation of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that address important clinical questions. Evaluation of the robustness of statistically significant outcomes adds a crucial element to the global assessment of trial findings. The purpose of this systematic review was to determine the robustness of ophthalmology RCTs through application of the Fragility Index (FI), a novel metric of the robustness of statistically significant outcomes. Design: Systematic review.
Methods: A literature search (MEDLINE) was performed for all RCTs published in top ophthalmology journals and ophthalmology-related RCTs published in high-impact journals in the past 10 years. Two reviewers independently screened 1811 identified articles for inclusion if they (1) were a human ophthalmology-related trial, (2) had a 1:1 prospective study design, and (3) reported a statistically significant dichotomous outcome in the abstract. All relevant data, including outcome, P value, number of patients in each group, number of events in each group, number of patients lost to follow-up, and trial characteristics, were extracted. The FI of each RCT was calculated and multivariate regression applied to determine predictive factors.
Results: The 156 trials had a median sample size of 91.5 (range, 13e2593) patients/eyes, and a median of 28 (range, 4e2217) events. The median FI of the included trials was 2 (range, 0e48), meaning that if 2 non-events were switched to events in the treatment group, the result would lose its statistical significance. A quarter of all trials had an FI of 1 or less, and 75\% of trials had an FI of 6 or less. The FI was less than the number of missing data points in 52.6\% of trials. Predictive factors for FI by multivariate regression included smaller P value (P {$<$} 0.001), larger sample size (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.001), larger number of events (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.011), and journal impact factor (P {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.029).
Conclusions: In ophthalmology trials, statistically significant dichotomous results are often fragile, meaning that a difference of only a couple of events can change the statistical significance. An application of the FI in RCTs may aid in the interpretation of results and assessment of quality of evidence.

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A review of RCTs in high-impact medical journals that reported a statistically significant result for at least one dichotomous or time-to-event outcome in the abstract. In the group with the smallest number of events, we changed the status of patients without an event to an event until the P-value exceeded 0.05. We labeled this number the Fragility Index; smaller numbers indicated a more fragile result.
RESULTS: The 399 eligible trials had a median sample size of 682 patients (range: 15-112,604) and a median of 112 events (range: 8-5,142); 53\% reported a P-value {$<$}0.01. The median Fragility Index was 8 (range: 0-109); 25\% had a Fragility Index of 3 or less. In 53\% of trials, the Fragility Index was less than the number of patients lost to follow-up.
CONCLUSION: The statistically significant results of many RCTs hinge on small numbers of events. The Fragility Index complements the P-value and helps identify less robust results.},
